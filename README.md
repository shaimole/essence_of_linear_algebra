# Practice project for learning python and basics of linear algebra

## General Idea
The Project is structured into sections corresponding with each video of the Youtube Series
[Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) by 3Blue1Brown on Youtube.
1. Vector
2. Span
3. Linear transformations
4. Matrix multiplication
5. 3D transformations
6. Determinant
7. Nonsquare matricies
8. Dot products
9. Cross products
10. Cross products as transformations
11. Cramers rule
12. Change of basis
13. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues
14. Computing eigenvectors
15. Abstract vector spaces

For each section the goal is to recreate the subject in python. E.g. for the first section the goal would be to create your own implementation of a vector in python. 

## Goals
- You should first commit one or more tests before you commit any implementation
- You should use python
- You should not use any external libraries (except for testing) when first tackling the problem
- When you got a working solution you should compare it to a solution offered by an external library (e.g. numpy)
- If you feel motivated, creating a visual/geometric representation (via python) is good practice.
